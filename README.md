ðŸ‘‹ I am Sam.  @cheneysamuel.  Currently an electronics technician in the US Navy.  I mainly work with radio communications but have hobbied in programming for some years now.

I have worked with VBA and javascript, and MSSQL in a former life.  After joining the Navy, my programming pursuits have mainly been in support of the ship or shore station.  Beside this, I have dabbled in node.js (node red and raspberry pi), and c (arduino), although these were more focused on interfacing with electronics projects. 

I have many interests, many of them technological.
